# MongoConfigs Wiki

Welcome to the MongoConfigs knowledge base. These pages walk you through installing the platform, modelling configuration data, synchronising message bundles, and applying production-ready practices in your plugin or application.

## Start Here

- [Installation](Installation) – connect your project to MongoDB and pull the library.
- [Creating Configs](Creating-Configs) – model typed configuration objects and push default values (single documents or one-per-ID).
- [Messages API](Messages-API) – build translatable message bundles backed by MongoConfigs (with async access patterns).
- [Messages API v2](Messages-API-v2) – zero-fluff reference of every async method on `ConfigManager`/`Messages`.
- [Placeholders Guide](Placeholders-Guide) – understand how placeholder replacement works inside Paper’s helper utilities.
- [Best Practices](Best-Practices) – keep runtime overhead low and your data tidy.
- [Example Plugin](Example-Plugin) – see a minimal Bukkit-style integration end to end.
- [Vibecoders Quick Reference](Vibecoders) – condensed notes for AI/code co-pilots that need the gist of configs, languages, and placeholders.

If this is your first time, follow the pages in the order listed above. The Vibecoders page is intentionally terse; it is meant for assistants that need canonical behaviour in a few lines.
